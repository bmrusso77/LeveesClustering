# LeveesClustering
Clustering shear wave velocity and electrical resistivity data collected on levees.

All python code was written in Google Colab. Different sections of the code were designed to be run at different times in Google Colab to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The code might not run properly if ran at all once.

The data brought into the code is formatted as a CSV containing shear wave velocity data, electrical resistivity data, and spatial coordinates including depth.
